# Pokemon Town Pixel Art!

This code corresponds with a blog post [https://chrisfrew.in/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/](https://chrisfrew.in/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/)

All of the generated images are already in this repository, but if you would like to tinker and re run the code, it runs simply with `python main.py` - looping through all 20 cities, making the png and svg tiles, as well as the neat hex art.
